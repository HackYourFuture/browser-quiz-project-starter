# Shared components

If you find you are re-using a type of functionality, in different places in the application then you would store that here.

We don't have any currently in the initial setup, but, for instance you might find that you are using a button over and over, or some part of your display such as a question. You could then put it in a library here, and call it wherever you need it in your application.
